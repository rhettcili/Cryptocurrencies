Cleaning a Cryptocurrency data set so that we can use unsupervised machine learning


For this project I was given a data set of over 1200 data points regarding cryptocurrency. First I had to clean the data down the a fraction of that, so that it could be used for unsupervised machine learning, and Principal Component Analysis. Once there were 3 Principal Components identified, the data could be clustered, and then visualized in a few ways to make the data more readable.
